Probably outdated, im not sure since i dont play the stupid fucking game anymore but if u want to update it(yourself) then just update the hash {moveavatar} outgoing packet since userupdate is a incoming packet the game cannot
scramble it 
If u want me to update it, 0.042 ETH only using metamask and no i dont use paypal so this is the only payment method i can take so cope with it
